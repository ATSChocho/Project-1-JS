# Project-1-JS
Here is the project one of javascript that Paul Even and I did.
We worked on a TODO-list web application.
The app is called Tick Tick.
The goal of the app is to be able to have different lists, each list can manage many tasks (there is no limit) and for each task you can also manage the advencement.
You can mark a task as done/finished, in progress or by default it will be higlited in red to say "not done".
In case you did a missclick and you marked a task done or in progress but it isn't there is a reset button
You can erase any task from any list.
You can also erase an entire list.
When you first connect there is a form that asks for your name and lastname.
It will then put your name and your last name in the upper left corner of the screen.
The web app is completly responsive.
